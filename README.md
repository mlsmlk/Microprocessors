# Microprocessors Labs
STMicroelectronics Discovery Kit for IoT, B-L475E-IOT01A1 board and STM32 Cube/ IDE were used for designing the labs. 
<br> <br>
__*Lab 0*__: Blink LED <br> <br>
 __*Lab  1*__: C, assembly and CMSIS-DSP library implementations of element wise matrix multiplication and standard deviation and comparision of execution time. <br> <br>
 __*Lab 2*__: Reading GPIO and generate output for digital to analog converter signals (DAC) <br><br>
 __*Lab 3*__: Calculating the operating temperature by usigin analog to digital converter (ADC) <br><br>
 __*Lab 4*__: Produce different frequencies on speaker by using direct memory access (DMA), timers and interrupts <br> <br>
 __*Lab 5*__: Use on-board MEMS microphone with the help of on-chip digital filter for sigma-delta modulators (DFSDM) <br> <br>
 __*Lab 6*__: Writing and reading by using quad SPI (QSPI) flash interface <br> <br>
 __*Lab 7*__: I2C Peripherals, UART, FreeRTOS
